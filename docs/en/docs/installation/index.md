# Installation Guide

## Environment Preparation

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (recommended version >= 20.0.0).
2. This project already includes `package.json` with `{"type": "module"}` set, so you don't need to create it manually.

## Installing Dependencies

After cloning the repository, execute the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

This will automatically install all necessary dependencies.
## Docker Deployment (Optional)

If you prefer to deploy the service using Docker, please refer to our [Docker Deployment Guide](./docker-deployment.md).

## Next Steps

After installation, you can continue reading the [Quick Start](../api-usage/startup.md) guide to configure and start the service.
